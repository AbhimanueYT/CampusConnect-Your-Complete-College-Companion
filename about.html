        <h1>The Genesis</h1>
          <p>Today, the beacon stands firm on massive 
             pillars, having stamped indelible imprints on the glorious
             academic traditions of India. This is the story of PRATHAP 
             FOUNDATION FOR EDUCATION AND TRAINING, the brainchild of the 
             great visionary Dr. G.P.C. Nayar, who wanted to redefine 
             educational standards in India by shaping it as a window to 
             the emerging market-driven global economy. 
                  <br>
                <br>
              
              </p>
              <p>
                Prathap Foundation 
                of Education and Training started its first academic institution,
                 the School of Communication and Management Studies (SCMS) in 1976,
                  which in later years earned fame and glory as a top business school.
                   It was rechristened as SCMS COCHIN SCHOOL OF BUSINESS in the year 2013.
                    The Foundation went on establishing institutions to offer professional
                     education in engineering, technology, management, hospitality, 
                     animation, biotech research, socio-economic research and other 
                     professional areas with the core concept of quality and excellence in
                      anything it does. Together, these institutions constitute SCMS GROUP 
                      OF EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS
              </p>
